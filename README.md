# Monday_Group_24_GroupAssignment

This is the repository for group assignment 2 - Pricing Model.

## Contribute rules

There should be 5 branches. One `main` branch, one `dev` branch and the other 3 personal branches.

The `main` branch should always be deployable. You cannot directly make any commits or pull requests to the `main` branch.

The `dev` branch contains our newest code, after you finish your code, you need to make a pull request to the `dev` branch, and we will merge it after we review it.

Only after we have made a careful test on the `dev` branch and make sure it can run properly, we then merge the `dev` branch to the `main` branch.

You should always make your own commits to your own branch.

Your commit message should be clearly state that what you have done in this commit.
